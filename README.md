# Reinforcement Learning Algorithms
A collection of Jupyter notebooks to demonstrate the implementation of different reinforcement learning algorithms, including temporal-difference methods such as Q-learning, and dynamic programming methods such as value iteration.

## Q-learning

## Gridworld

## Racetrack
Used a racetrack environment where the agent had to control a car to find the optimum policy for driving around a corner. Project includes implementations using on-policy first-visit Monte Carlo, Sarsa, and Q-learning, with a comparison between their learning curves. Also includes an implementation of Watkins's Q(&lambda;) with a comparison to Q-learning.
